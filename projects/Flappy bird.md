Players control a bird character by continuously clicking on the screen or pressing keyboard buttons to fly in the air and avoid random pipe obstacles appearing above and below. The background is pixelated blue sky, accompanied by moving clouds, adding some dynamic effects to the game. The scores are displayed at the top of the screen, and players need to pass through as many pipes as possible without touching them in order to obtain higher scores. During the development process, I learned how to use Pygame to handle physics simulations, collision detection, and simple animation effects.
